## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

The major learnings I had while working with this project are: (1) First, *ternary operators*. I learned how to use ternary operators to write a short but robust code. (2) Second, *useState hook*. I learned how to use one of the most used and important hooks in React. (3) Third, *conditional rendering*. I learned how to render a specific component depending on the outcome of the condition. (4) Finally, *passing props*. I learned how to pass props from one component to another.

Some of the code snippets:

```tsx
<button className='w-full py-3 bg-orange text-white text-sm rounded-full tracking-widest font-bold active:bg-white active:text-orange ease-in-out duration-300' onClick={activeIndex > 0 ? () => setSubmitted(true) : () => alert('Please select a number for rating')}>SUBMIT</button>
```

```tsx
{ submitted === false ?
  ...
  : <Submitted rating={activeIndex} />
}
```

```tsx
type Rating = {
    rating: number;
}

function Submitted(props: Rating) {
    return(
        <>
          ...
            <p>You selected {props.rating} out of 5</p>
          ...
        </>
    );
}
```

### Continued development

The concept(s) that I'm still not completely comfortable with:
- useState hook

- [Passing Props in React using Typescript](https://dev.to/mconner89/passing-props-in-react-using-typescript-20lm) - This helped me understand how to use 'type' in Typescript when passing props in React.
